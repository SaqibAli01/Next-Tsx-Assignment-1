                And it is always the same questions that came to us from our suppliers: “Hey can you move apparel? I have too much of this brand etc...”, or “Can you buy any accessories?”, “Can you move soccer shoes?”, “I received another shipment of this model ;can you buy more or help me move more now?” etc...

                Well the answer was: “We don’t have any clients for those items, or let me ask around”

              <p>2. Reality
                Stores are flooded with quantities of the same items, so what do they do? They flip them on well
                known resell platform/marketplace; and we are all very familiar with these marketplaces...
                . How can you sell some Yeezys or Nike, when buyers/bidders are

                1.
                Sell all your sleeping inventory on certain platforms one by one etc. (and for sure , some models will not even sell ...so it’s a loss).Shipping will take a while, and you are wasting time & labor...
                2.
                Wholesale them to some entity or reseller you trust.But again they might only want to buy the good and the average stuff, that they can flip.
